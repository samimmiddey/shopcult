## **ABOUT**

This is a personal project created for learning and development purposes. The main movtive behind creating such a big and complex project is to familiarize myself with as much complexities as possible. Because things like authentication, payment gateway, state management are some of the essential parts of any modern website, therefore implementing these features was a major target in this project. Although some of the features are in test mode only.
